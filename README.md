# Mamoochi - Headless, Git-Native, Serverless CMS & Web Platform Framework

Mamoochi is a modern, headless CMS and web platform framework designed for developers who value scalability, modularity, and a streamlined developer experience. By combining a Git-based workflow with real-time and decentralized features, Mamoochi offers a robust solution for building high-performance, content-rich websites and applications.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Mamoochi leverages cutting-edge technologies and serverless infrastructure to deliver a seamless headless experience. Key benefits include:

- **Headless-First Architecture:**  
  Clearly separated backend content management from frontend rendering, using Nuxt and Vue 3 for both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

- **Git-Native Versioning:**  
  Content edits become commits grouped into builds and pushed directly to GitHub, ensuring transparent and reliable version control.

- **Serverless & Globally Scalable:**  
  Powered by Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, D1, and KV storage for fast, auto-scaled, globally distributed deployments.

- **Real-Time & Decentralized:**  
  Real-time collaboration via Cloudflare Durable Objects and decentralized messaging and authentication with the Nostr protocol.

- **Extensible by Design:**  
  A flexible plugin system that enables customization of routes, middleware, dashboards, authentication methods, and monetization strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### Frontend & User Interface

- **Nuxt & Vue 3:**  
  Enables powerful, reactive components with support for SSR and SSG for optimized performance and SEO.

- **Tiptap Markdown Editor:**  
  Rich-text visual editing with support for YAML front matter, enhancing content management without exposing metadata directly to editors.

- **TailwindCSS & Nuxt UI:**  
  Rapid and consistent UI development through utility-first CSS and a library of pre-built components.

### Backend & API

- **Cloudflare Workers:**  
  Serverless backend providing global, low-latency API responses without infrastructure overhead.

- **Cloudflare D1 & KV Storage:**  
  Structured, scalable data management through D1 SQL and fast, global key-value caching with KV storage.

- **Durable Objects:**  
  Real-time state management for collaborative features such as live editing, real-time updates, and persistent WebSocket connections.

- **Drizzle ORM:**  
  A type-safe, developer-friendly ORM that simplifies interactions with Cloudflare D1 databases.

### Git-Based Content Management & CI/CD

- **Commit & Build System:**  
  Changes are managed as commits with clear metadata, grouped into logical builds for organized review and controlled deployment.

- **GitHub Integration:**  
  Direct API-driven workflow:
  - Creates Git trees for modified files
  - Generates new commits on designated branches (e.g., `develop`, `main`)
  - Automatically triggers Cloudflare Pages CI/CD for deployment

### Real-Time & Decentralized Communication

- **Nostr Protocol:**  
  Decentralized identity, messaging, notifications, and collaborative real-time features without relying on centralized infrastructure.

- **Durable Objects:**  
  Ensures consistent real-time state management for collaborative editing and instant updates across users.

### Plugin & Extensibility

- **Modular Plugin System:**  
  Extensible architecture allowing developers to build custom integrations, middleware, routes, dashboards, and authentication workflows without altering core functionalities.
